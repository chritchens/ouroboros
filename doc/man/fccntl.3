.SH NAME

fccntl \- control commands for flows and FRCT connections

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B #include <ouroboros/fccntl.h>

\fBint fccntl(int \fIfd\fB, int \fIcmd\fB, ...);

Compile and link with \fI-louroboros-dev\fR.

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBfccntl\fR() is used to control the configuration of flows and
connections.

Supported commands are:

\fBFLOWSSNDTIMEO\fR - set the sender timeout. Takes a \fBstruct
timespec * \fItimeo\fR as third argument. Passing NULL for \fItimeo\fR
disables the timeout.

\fBFLOWGSNDTIMEO\fR - retrieve the current sender timeout. Takes a
\fBstruct timespec * \fItimeo\fR as third argument.

\fBFLOWSRCVTIMEO\fR - set the receiver timeout. Takes a \fBstruct
timespec * \fItimeo\fR as third argument. Passing NULL for \fItimeo\fR
disables the timeout.

\fBFLOWGRCVTIMEO\fR - retrieve the current receiver timeout. Takes a
\fBstruct timespec * \fItimeo\fR as third argument.

\fBFLOWGQOSSPEC\fR  - retrieve the current QoS specification of the
flow. Takes a \fBqosspec_t * \fIqs\fR as third argument.

\fBFLOWSFLAGS\fR    - set flow flags. Takes flow flags as third
argument. Supported flags are:

.RS 8
\fIFLOWFRDONLY\fR   - set flow to read-only.

\fIFLOWFWRONLY\fR   - set flow_to write-only.

\fIFLOWFRDWR\fR     - set flow to read-write.

\fIFLOWFDOWN\fR     - mark flow as down.

\fIFLOWFRNOBLOCK\fR - set read to non-blocking.

\fIFLOWFWNOBLOCK\fR - set write to non-blocking.

\fIFLOWFNONBLOCK\fR - set I/O to non-blocking read/write.

\fIFLOWFDEFAULT\fR  - set flow defaults (blocking, read-write).

.RE

\fBFLOWGFLAGS\fR    - get the current flow flags. Takes an \fBuint32_t
\fIflags\fR as third argument.

\fBFRCTSFLAGS\fR    - set FRCT flags. Takes FRCT flags as third
argument. Supported flags are:

.RS 8
\fIFRCTFRESCNTRL\fR - enable resource control.

\fIFRCTFRTX\fR      - enable retransmission.

\fIFRCTFERRCHCK\fR  - enable checksum (CRC32).

\fIFRCTFORDERING\fR - enable packet in-order delivery.

\fIFRCTFPARTIAL\fR  - enable partial delivery.

.RE

\fBFRCTGFLAGS\fR    - get the current flow flags. Takes an \fBuint16_t
\fIflags\fR as third argument.

.SH RETURN VALUE

On success, \fBfccntl\fR() returns 0.

.SH ERRORS

\fBfccntl\fR() can return

.B -EINVAL
An invalid argument was passed.

.B -EPERM
Operation not permitted. This is returned when requesting the value of
a timeout (FLOWGSNDTIMEO or FLOWGRCVTIMEO) when no such timeout was
set.

.B -EBADF
Invalid flow descriptor passed.

.B -ENOTALLOC
Flow is not allocated.

.B -ENOTSUP
The specified command is not supported.
